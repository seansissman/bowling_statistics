We should come up with the inputs needed.

This is what I came up with.

I figure once the team's are set up and the player handicap has been set - the only thing you want to input is the player and the score.

Player, Team, and Score.

Player Table
_____________
Playerid -- Player Name -- Handicap

Team Table
_________
LeagueID -- TeamID -- Playerid

Score tables
_________
Date -- MatchID -- PlayerID --- Raw Score ---Handicap Adj Score

Matchup (Schedule) Table
_________
MatchID -- HomeTeam (TeamID) -- AwayTeam (TeamID) -- Date

Season Table (this doesn't seem right, but I think we need to create like a League Season so you can keep track over many seasons and also I think we should consider making it for many different leagues. That way if we put it out on the web other Bowling leagues can use it. 

Have it so that each league can only see their own stuff.

______
SeasonID -- TeamID
